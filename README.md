# ATM-pin-and-balance
A simple yet practical Python project that simulates an ATM PIN verification system. It’s designed with beginners in mind, helping you practice loops, conditionals, and error handling while building something that feels real-world.

✨ Features
PIN verification – enter your PIN to access the system

Limited attempts – only a set number of tries before access is blocked

Invalid input handling – catches non-numeric or incorrect entries gracefully

Beginner-friendly code – clean, easy to read, and modify

Command Line Interface (CLI) – simple text-based interaction

🧠 How It Works
The program asks the user to enter their PIN.

If the PIN is correct, access is granted.

If the PIN is wrong, the user gets another chance—up to a limited number of attempts.

If the user enters invalid input (like letters instead of numbers), the program warns them instead of crashing.

After exceeding the allowed attempts, the system locks out further access.
